## Using CSS/HTML to Make a Responsive Website

In this project, you will implement from scratch, without any library, a web page. You will use all HTML/CSS/Accessibility/Responsive design knowledges that you learned previously.

You wonâ€™t have a lot of instruction, you are free to implement it the way that you want - the objective is simple: Have a fully functional web page that looks the same as the designer file. [Project](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/2ED3P1a2wnbQqRLi8aXJKw)

## Interactions note:

 - -   The web page must switch to the mobile version when the screen width is 480px or less
 - -   Links hover/active:  `#FF6565`
- -   Button hover/active:  `opacity: 0.9`
-  - Max width of the content: 1000px centered in the page
